# Python Practice - Chapter 6

This repository contains Python practice files covering **Conditional Expressions**.

## Topics Covered

### Conditional Statements
- **`if` Statement** → Executes code if the condition is `True` (indentation is important).
- **`elif` (Else If)** → Used for multiple conditions.
- **`else`** → Executes when all previous conditions fail.

#### Workflow:
1. `if` condition is checked first.
2. If `if` fails, `elif` is checked.
3. If all conditions fail, `else` runs.

### Relational (Comparison) Operators:
- `==` → Equal to  
- `>=` → Greater than or equal to  
- `<=` → Less than or equal to  

### Logical Operators:
- `and` → `True` if **both** conditions are true, else `False`.
- `or` → `True` if **at least one** condition is true.
- `not` → Inverts `True` to `False` and vice versa.
