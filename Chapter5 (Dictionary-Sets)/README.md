# Python Practice Chapter 5

This repository contains my Python practice files covering various topics.

## Topics Covered

### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are key-value pairs.
- They are mutable, similar to lists.
- An empty dictionary can be created using `{}`.
- The type of a dictionary is `dict`.

#### Useful Methods:
- `.keys()` - Returns all the keys.
- `.values()` - Returns all the values.
- `.update()` - Updates the dictionary with new key-value pairs.

### Sets
- Sets and dictionaries both use `{}` syntax.
- Sets contain only values (no keys, unlike dictionaries).
- They do not allow duplicate values and are unordered.
- Sets are immutable, similar to strings.
